//* Classes (Reference Type)

//* Main component of the program
//* When we define a class, we can define the members it holds

//* This is just the definition, JUST A BLUEPRINT

//* The idea is to have multiple objects talking to one another OOP (Object Oriented Programming)

//* Making our first object




//todo: once you've made a class, we can make 'Copies' of that class
//todo: 2. Add reference to _08_Classes (namespace) [ctrl + .]
using _08_Classes;

Donut doug = new Donut();

System.Console.WriteLine(doug); //_08_Classes.Donut -> This is just the reference location


//EX: Make a class
namespace _08_Classes
{
    //Our class: (20-26)
    public class Donut
    {

    }
}
