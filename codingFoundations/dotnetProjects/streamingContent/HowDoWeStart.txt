1. Structured Layers
    A. Data Layer -> Domain Objects (objs that our app will use)
    B. Repository Layer -> Collection of stuff that the User can interact with
    C. UI Layer (User Interface) -> Stuff the User interacts with

2. Console is the FRONT FACING APPLICATION

Data Layer & Repository Layer are just class libraries

3. We need to link these guys together (Data, Repository, UI)
    A. UI -> Data -> Repository (dotnet Reference)
    B. Repository -> Data Layer
    C. Data (All by itself...ground zero)
